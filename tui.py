"""
TUI is short for Text-User Interface. This module is responsible for communicating with the user.
The functions in this module will display information to the user and/or retrieve a response from the user.
Each function in this module should utilise any parameters and perform user input/output.
A function may also need to format and/or structure a response e.g. return a list, tuple, etc.
Any errors or invalid inputs should be handled appropriately.
Please note that you do not need to read the data file or perform any other such processing in this module.

    Task 8: Display a record. Only the data for the specified column indexes will be displayed.

    The parameter cols is a list of column indexes e.g. [0,3,5]
    The function should display a list of values.
    The displayed list should only consist of those values whose column index is in cols.

    the following should be displayed:

    cols        this is a list of integer values that represent column indexes.
                the default value for this is None.

    You will need to add these parameters to the function definition.
