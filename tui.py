"""
TUI is short for Text-User Interface. This module is responsible for communicating with the user.
The functions in this module will display information to the user and/or retrieve a response from the user.
Each function in this module should utilise any parameters and perform user input/output.
A function may also need to format and/or structure a response e.g. return a list, tuple, etc.
Any errors or invalid inputs should be handled appropriately.
Please note that you do not need to read the data file or perform any other such processing in this module.

    Task 4: Display a menu of options and read the user's response.

    If no value or a zero is supplied for the parameter 'variant' then a menu with the following options
    should be displayed:

    '[1] Process Data', '[2] Visualise Data', '[3] Export Data' and '[4] Exit'

    If the value of the parameter 'variant' is 1 then a menu with the following options should be displayed:

    '[1] Record by Serial Number', '[2] Records by Observation Date', '[3] Group Records by Country/Region,
    '[4] Summarise Records'

    If the value of the parameter 'variant' is 2 then a menu with the following options should be displayed:

    '[1] Country/Region Pie Chart', '[2] Observations Chart', '[3] Animated Summary'

    If the value of the parameter 'variant' is 3 then a menu with the following options should be displayed:

    '[1] All Data', '[2] Data for Specific Country/Region'

    In each of the above cases, the user's response should be read in and returned as an integer
    corresponding to the selected option.
    E.g. 1 for 'Process Data', 2 for 'Visualise Data' and so on.

    If the user enters a invalid option then a suitable error message should be displayed

    a four digit year e.g. 01/22/2020

    Task 8: Display a record. Only the data for the specified column indexes will be displayed.
    If no column indexes have been specified, then all the data for the record will be displayed.

    The parameter record is a list of values e.g. [1,'01/22/2020','Anhui','Mainland China','1/22/2020 17:00',1,0,0]
    The parameter cols is a list of column indexes e.g. [0,3,5]
    The function should display a list of values.
    The displayed list should only consist of those values whose column index is in cols.

    E.g. if cols is [1,3] then for the record [1,'01/22/2020','Anhui','Mainland China','1/22/2020 17:00',1,0,0]
    the following should be displayed:

    the following should be displayed:

    Task 9: Display each record in the specified list of records.
    Only the data for the specified column indexes will be displayed.
    If no column indexes have been specified, then all the data for a movie will be displayed.

    The function should have two parameters as follows:

    records     which is a list of records where each record itself is a list of data values.
    cols        this is a list of integer values that represent column indexes.
                the default value for this is None.

    You will need to add these parameters to the function definition.

    The function should iterate through each record in records and display the record.

    Each record should be displayed as a list of values e.g. [1,01/22/2020,Anhui,Mainland China,1/22/2020 17:00,1,0,0]
    Only the columns whose indexes are included in cols should be displayed for each record.
